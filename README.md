# PBSuite

I have hosted this version of PBSuite here so that I can easily manage this code across several machines, as well as make and track changes as needed. This code was developed by Adam English. It has been slightly modified to improve compatibility with recent versions of BLASR. Thus the code here is not quite even with v15.8.24, but it is essentially the same.
